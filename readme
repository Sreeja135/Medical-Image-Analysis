MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS USING DEEP LEARNING
Overview: 
This project leverages deep learning to address two key challenges in medical imaging:
1.Bone Age Prediction – Estimating skeletal maturity using hand X-ray images.
2.Brain Tumor Detection – Identifying and segmenting tumors from brain MRI scans.
Using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the models are designed to assist medical 
professionals in delivering faster and more accurate diagnostics.

Key Technologies & Techniques:
1.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
2.U-Net, V-Net, Mask R-CNN for segmentation tasks
3.Transfer Learning using pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50)
4.Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data and improvement
5.Image Preprocessing & Augmentation.

Use Cases:
1. Bone Age Prediction:
Dataset: Hand X-ray images
Approach: Regression-based CNN to predict age
Evaluation: MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
2.Brain Tumor Detection:
Dataset: Brain MRI images (with labeled tumor regions)
Approach: U-Net + Transfer Learning for pixel-level segmentation
Evaluation: Dice Coefficient, IoU.
